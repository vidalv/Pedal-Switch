How to build a Guitare Pedal Switcher based on Arduino

Recently I started to think about how to organize my guitar pedals. 
On the market you can find, for several hundred euros, switchers allowing certain combinations. 
As you have to be realistic, I decided on an 8-channel version, but the use of a specialized ADI circuit 
can allow an (almost) limitless extension to your ideas.
For the moment, I am at the electronic diagrams, then I will start a prototype on a bread-board.
